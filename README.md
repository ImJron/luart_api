# LuaRT - API

[![LuaRT](https://img.shields.io/badge/LuaRT-_2.1.0-blue)](http://luart.org/)

The complete API documentation of [LuaRT](https://luart.org/) contained in a Lua table, fully annotated for autocomplete using the Lua Language Server.

The API information is updated manually based on the [LuaRT wiki](https://www.luart.org/doc/modules.html). Therefore there is no guarantee that everything is correct and up to date.

---

## Getting Started

Simply drop the "_luart" folder at the top of your project root. Thats it!
